This supplementary data contains the radial torque density and angular momentum flux profiles as computed by the linear theory framework in Fairbairn & Dittmann 2025. See details on the problem setup in the paper.

The data is contained in a directory tree which is split into three disc profiles and four planetary eccentricity profiles.

The three disc profiles considered have $(p,q) \in [(1.5,0.0),(1.5,1.0),(0.5,0.0)]$ for the surface density and temperature power law exponents.

In each directory we provide the results for four eccentricities $e \in (0.01,0.06,0.12,0.30)$.

We addionally provide the script [`read_data.py'](read_data.py) which shows how to read in and plot this data.
