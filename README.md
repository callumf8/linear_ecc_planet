# README

This supplementary data contains the radial torque density and angular momentum flux profiles as computed by the linear theory framework in Fairbairn & Dittmann 2025. See details on the problem setup in the paper.

The data is contained in a directory tree which is split into three disc profiles and four planetary eccentricity profiles.

The three disc profiles considered have '$(p,q) \in [(1.5,0.0),(1.5,1.0),(0.5,0.0)]$'
